# Signing Up

To begin using TrackBear, you'll need to sign up for an account.

## Making an account

Start by going to the [signup page](https://trackbear.app/signup) or click **Sign up** on the TrackBear homepage. Here's what you'll see:

Put in your desired username, your email address, and a password, and click **Sign up**. Once you've signed up, you'll be prompted to log in. Enter the username and password you just entered, and you'll be taken to the Dashboard, which looks like this:

## Verifying your email address

See that bright orange header? That’s a reminder to verify your email address. To do this, go to your email inbox and look for an email from noreply@trackbear.app with the subject line *Verify your email address*. (Don't forget to check your spam and junk folders!) Open it up and click the link inside.

::: warning Don't delay!
You have ten days to verify your email address. If you don’t, your account will be suspended. If you do not see the email you can click the big orange “resend verification” button and TrackBear will send you the link again. If you truly cannot find it, or if you forget and time runs out, you can email TrackBear support at trackbearapp+support@gmail.com and the bear behind the scenes will help you.

Clicking the link to verify your email address will bring you back to TrackBear’s website. You will then be prompted to log in again, just like you did before, and you'll be back at the Dashboard.

And that’s it! Congratulations, writer, you have created a TrackBear account. Your train is on the tracks! The next stop is to [make a project](./make-a-project) to track your writing.
