# Looking for an app?

TrackBear is designed to work equally well in both desktop and mobile web browsers, meaning there's no need for a separate app. But if you still want a dedicated TrackBear app on your home screen, taskbar, or dock, there *is* a way... Find your device and browser below to learn how.

::: tip Why isn't there a TrackBear app in the app store?
In short, time and money. If I made dedicated apps for iOS and Android, I'd have to implement every feature three times and fix every bug three times, which means fewer features get added and fewer bugs get fixed. It also costs money to list an app in the iOS and Android app stores. I'd rather spend that money on the servers that power TrackBear and the coffee that powers my coding!

::: warning A note about installing TrackBear via Firefox
Unfortunately, [Firefox on desktop doesn't support installing TrackBear natively](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/Making_PWAs_installable#browser_support). This is pretty frustrating, to be honest, because I love Firefox and it's the browser I use to help me make TrackBear.

There *is* a workaround using an extension, which I have put instructions for below, but it's cumbersome, a bit technical, and requires you to install additional software. Instead, I recommend following the instructions under Edge, Safari, or Chrome.
