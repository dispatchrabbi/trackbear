# Projects

Projects are the main way to organize your work in TrackBear. You should create a separate one for every project you want to track.

## Manage your projects

In order to see all your projects, click the **Projects** link on the sidebar and you'll be taken to [the Projects page](https://trackbear.app/works).

From here, you can click **New** to create a new project, **Import** to import projects from an outside source, star or unstar projects, or click on one of your projects to see your progress and more detailed information.

## Star a project

On the Projects page, click the star icon on a project to star or un-star it. We recommend that you star the projects that you most frequently access.

Starred projects will show up at the top of the list on the Projects page, and at the top of any Project dropdown (say, in the Enter Progress dialog or when creating a goal). Starred projects will also show up as links in the sidebar for quick access.

## See project details

You can see all the details about your project on the project details page. To get here, start on [the Projects page](https://trackbear.app/works) and click your project.

To learn more about the [activity heatmap](/using-trackbear/tracking-progress#activity-heatmap), [graph](/using-trackbear/tracking-progress#graph), and [table](/using-trackbear/tracking-progress#table), check out the [Tracking Progress help page](/using-trackbear/tracking-progress#seeing-your-progress).

## Create a new project

In order to create a new project, click the **New** button in the top right of [the Projects page](https://trackbear.app/works). You'll be presented with the **Create Project** dialog:

Here's what each field does:

- **Title:** The title for your project.

- **Description:** A description for your project.

- **Show on profile?** Toggle this switch to show this project on your [public profile](/settings/public-profile). (This has no effect if your profile is not enabled.)

- **Phase:** What stage of development your project is at. Your choices are *Planning*, *Outlining*, *Drafting*, *Revising*, *On Hold*, *Finished*, or *Abandoned*. This field is mostly useful for your own recordkeeping, though you can also sort the list of Projects by phase.

- **Starting Balance:** If you are creating a new project in TrackBear, but you've already done some work on it, use the starting balance to tell TrackBear about your previous work. Click the **Add Starting Balance** button, select the correct measure (words, time, etc.), and enter your existing count. You can enter multiple starting balances if you've been tracking, say, both words and pages.

To remove a starting balance, click the red minus button to the right of the starting balance.

::: tip Where do starting balances count?
Starting balances are there to make sure your headline project numbers are correct. Your starting balances count for any totals (on your project page, on your stats page, and on your profile) but they don't count as activity. That means your goals and leaderboards won't take your starting balances into account, and starting balances don't affect activity heatmaps.

Once you've filled in information about your new project, click **Submit** and you'll see your new project in the projects list.

## Edit a project

In order to edit a project's title, description, or other properties, go to that project's page and click the **Configure Project** button. You'll be brought to the Configure Project page, at the top of which you should see the *Edit Project* section:

![A screenshot of the Edit Project section on the Configure Project page.](/images/help/edit-project.png)

All of the fields on this page act the same way as the fields in the [Create Project dialog](#create-a-new-project). When you're done, click **Edit** to save your changes.

## Add a cover

To add a cover to your project or replace your current cover, go to that project's page and click the **Configure Project** button. You'll be brought to the Configure Project page; scroll down until you see the *Upload a Cover* section. Click the **Upload** button and you'll see this dialog:

![A screenshot of the Upload Cover dialog with no image chosen.](/images/help/upload-cover-blank.png)

From here, you can either click **Choose** to browse for an image, or you can drag-and-drop an image onto the dialog box to choose it.

::: info Cover image requirements
Cover images must be 2MB or less and can be AVIF, GIF, JPEG, PNG, SVG, or WEBP format. For best results, your cover image should have a 2:3 aspect ratio. If you go with something like 640px wide by 960px tall, you should be good.
:::

Once you've chosen an image, click **Upload** to upload your cover.

## Remove a cover

To add a cover to your project or replace your current cover, go to that project's page and click the **Configure Project** button. You'll be brought to the Configure Project page; scroll down until you see the *Upload a Cover* section.

Click the **Remove** button, then click **Yes** on the popup to confirm. Your cover will be removed.

## Delete a project

To delete a project, go to that project's page and click the **Delete Project** button. You'll be asked to type the project's name as confirmation. Do so, and click **Delete**. The project will be deleted.
